    <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <p><b>Chole Bhature</b> is a popular North Indian dish consisting of a spicy chickpea curry (Chole) served with deep-fried, puffed bread (Bhature). It's a hearty and flavorful meal, often enjoyed for breakfast or lunch. The dish is known for its contrasting textures and the rich, tangy taste of the chole. </p>

    <p><b>Chole (Chickpea Curry):</b> The chole is a flavorful and spicy curry made with chickpeas (chana) as the base. It's typically cooked with a blend of aromatic Indian spices like turmeric, chili powder, coriander, and garam masala, creating a tangy and savory gravy. The chole is often garnished with chopped onions, green chilies, and cilantro. </p>
    
    <p><b>Bhature (Fried Bread):</b> Bhature is a leavened, deep-fried bread made from maida (refined wheat flour). It's characterized by its puffy, golden-brown appearance and soft, slightly chewy texture when freshly fried. The dough for bhature is typically made with maida, yogurt, and a touch of sugar, then left to rise before being rolled out and fried. </p>

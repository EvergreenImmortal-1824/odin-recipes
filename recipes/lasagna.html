    <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <p><b>>Roasted Butternut Squash and Garlic Lasagna Recipe</b> is a hearty and flavorful vegetarian pasta dish that takes a delightful twist on a classic comfort food. Instead of a traditional red sauce, it features layers of roasted butternut squash and garlic infused with creamy sauce and herbs. </p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds butternut squash, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 quart milk</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>9 no-cook lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STEPS:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Brush butternut squash halves with vegetable oil and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until golden and easily pierced with a knife, 45 to 50 minutes. 
            Cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then scoop flesh into a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot butter 
            until softened. Stir in flour and cook for 3 minutes. Whisk in milk until smooth. Bring 
            to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in 
            butternut squash flesh and season with salt and pepper. Butternut sauce can be made 3 days ahead and refrigerated.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Beat heavy cream in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until foamy. Gradually season with salt, 
            continuing to beat until medium peaks form. Lift the beater or whisk straight up: 
            the tip of the peak should curl over slightly. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 cup butternut sauce into the prepared baking dish and place 3 lasagna noodles on 
            top in a single layer. Spread 1/2 of remaining sauce over noodles and sprinkle with 
            1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover with another layer of noodles, spread remaining sauce on top, 
            and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Place final layer of noodles on top. Spread whipped 
            cream over noodles, making sure pasta is completely covered. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup 
            Parmesan cheese. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is bubbly and golden brown, 
            about 10 minutes. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
